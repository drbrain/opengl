Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`



Build instructions
------------------

The current build is still under construction. `:)`

Soon, to build, you'll just run `rake` at the top level.  This will do
everything necessary to build the OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT bindings for
Ruby.  The top level Rakefile will dig down into the subdirectories
under `ext` and build the various components.


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run a sample file:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby plane.rb

Just hit ESC to exit the super-interesting OpenGL program.
