Usage tutorial
==============

Naming conventions
------------------

There are two ways to use ruby-opengl. Firstly, you can use customary
C-style method names and constant names like so:

    {{ruby}}
    require 'gl'
    require 'glu'
    require 'glut'
    
    include Gl
    include Glu
    include Glut

    glFooBar( GL_FOO_BAR )
    gluFooBar( GLU_FOO_BAR )
    glutFooBar( GLUT_FOO_BAR )

You don't have to `include` Gl, Glu, and Glut, but if you don't, then
you'll have to prefix each of those method and constant names like so:

    {{ruby}}
    Gl.glFooBar( Gl::GL_FOO_BAR )
    Glu.gluFooBar( Glu::GLU_FOO_BAR )
    Glut.glutFooBar( Glut::GLUT_FOO_BAR )

The other way you might use ruby-opengl is to employ the notation that
users of previous versions of ruby-opengl have used:

    {{ruby}}
    require 'gl_prev'
    require 'glu_prev'
    require 'glut_prev'
    
    GL.FooBar( GL::FOO_BAR )
    GLU.FooBar( GLU::FOO_BAR )
    GLUT.FooBar( GLUT::FOO_BAR )

There are many fine OpenGL and GLUT tutorials all over the 'Net, so we
don't plan on trying to duplicate them here at the moment. Most of
these tutorials presume you are writing your code in C or C++, but
they should still be almost directly usable with ruby-opengl as long
as you use the C-style names (and, of course, as long as you change
the rest of the C code you find from C (or C++) to Ruby). If you opt
for using the legacy ruby-opengl style names, you'll have to take the
additional step of converting the calls from `glFooBar( GL_FOO_BAR )`
to `GL.FooBar( GL::FOO_BAR )`.

Personally, I prefer the current C-style names because:

1. It's somewhat easier to follow along with the many online tutorials
   and written OpenGL/GLUT books (i.e. the RedBook, BlueBook, SuperBible,
   etc.).

2. Copying/pasting code between Ruby and C is easier (otherwise you'll
   be doing a lot of search/replace).

3. My fingers are already used to typing the traditional C-style names
   of all these identifiers.

Also, I don't like the fact that, if you use the previous ruby-opengl
style, you've got method names starting with a capital letter (which is
not customary Ruby style).

For the rest of this document, I'll use the current C-style names.


GLUT callbacks
--------------

The major difference from your GL code in C is in how glut callbacks are
handled. Rather than define your callbacks as top-level functions,
with ruby-opengl, it's done (for example) like so:

    {{ruby}}
    reshape = lambda do |w, h|
        glViewport( ... )
        glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION )
        # etc.
        glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW )
        glLoadIdentity
    end

    # ...
    
    glutReshapeFunc( reshape )

An older notation you'll see instead of `lambda` is `proc`. The PickAxe
v2 notes that `proc` is "mildly deprecated" in favor of `lambda`. You'll
also sometimes see `Proc.new` used in place of either. Pages 359-360 of
PickAxe v2 describe the differences between using `lambda` and `Proc.new`,
but for our purposes either will be fine.


The Samples
-----------

To run the samples, manually pass them to `ruby` like so:

    ruby some_sample.rb
    ruby some_sample_prev.rb

The names ending in `_prev.rb` have been "ported" to use the legacy method
and constant names (and possibly have been neatened up a bit as well). The
`README` file in the `samples` directory contains some notes on the samples.


Mac OS X notes
--------------

James Adam passed along some fixes to ruby-opengl in 2005 on ruby-talk.
Some methods have been incorporated into ruby-opengl-0.33. Paraphrasing
James a bit, he writes:

> 1. `CheckLoop` was added to bring the GLUT module in line with the
>    same function in Apple's GLUT. GLUT's MainLoop is blocking and forces
>    you to perform additoinal processing using GLUT's IdleFunc system,
>    which can sometimes be very undesirable (particularly if you are using
>    Ruby as the glue between two libraries which both feature this type of
>    loop). CheckLoop allows you to cycle through a *single* GLUT processing
>    loop, and then returns control to the calling thread/process. Thus, by
>    periodically calling CheckLoop, you can get the scene to update without
>    having GLUT seize control of the whole application.
> 
> 2. `GameModeString(mode_string)` and `Glut.EnterGameMode()`. May allow you
>    to switch your application to fullscreen.
> 
> 3. `BitmapCharacterX(char)` for displaying characters, since there seems to
>    be a problem with the default `GLUT.BitmapCharacter` method.

Any feedback on testing of these methods is welcome, and will likely
be incorporated into the ruby-opengl docs.
