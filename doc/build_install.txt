Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`

On Gentoo, you MUST have rubygems 0.9.x or higher installed.  Using the
base 0.8.x in the portage tree will not work.

On OS X, you will need to install your own version of Ruby as the
version that ships with OS X has known problems with properly building
ruby-opengl bindings.  You'll also need XCode for gcc and tools.  Macports
or fink should handle this cleanly.

Manual Build instructions
------------------

1. Install rake

   gem install -y rake
2. Install mkrf (Need at least version 0.2.0)
   
   gem install -y mkrf
3. Run 'rake' at the top level of the project
4. Run 'rake gem' to build a gem
5. Run 'gem install pkg/ruby-opengl-<version>.gem' to install the gem


Installing from rubygems
-------------------

ruby-opengl should also support being installed via gems now.  Just
try 'gem install -y ruby-opengl' and it should pull down the gem
and try to build the bindings for you automatically.


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run unit tests:
   $ rake test

To run the interactive tests:
   $ rake test_interactive

To run all the tests:
   $ rake test_all

To run a sample file:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby plane.rb

Hit ESC to exit.
