Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby and the Rake gem, you'll need the following
packages:

* `libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`



Build instructions
------------------

The current build setup is still under construction. We're waiting for
the next mkrf release so we can transition over. So, some extconf.rb's are
in place and you can use them if you've got the version of mkrf in svn
installed (in fact, on GNU/Linux, with the cutting edge mkrf you can
use the included `build.sh` to build).

Currently, to build, just run `rake` at the top level.  This should do
everything necessary to build the OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT bindings for
Ruby.  The top level Rakefile will dig down into the subdirectories
under `ext` and build the various components.

After building, the extension modules are automatically copied to the
project's `./lib` directory.


Installing
----------

For now, if you want to install ruby-opengl on your system, you can
do so manually (there is no gem for it yet). Just copy the contents
of `./lib` into your `.../lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8` directory (or
anywhere else `ruby` searches for modules).


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run a sample file:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby plane.rb

Just hit ESC to exit the super-interesting OpenGL program.
