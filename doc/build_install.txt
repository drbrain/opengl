Building ruby-opengl
====================


Pre-requisites
--------------

On Ubuntu, aside from Ruby you'll need the following:

* `rdoc ri ruby1.8-dev`

For OpenGL related headers you'll need the following packages:

* `libgl1-mesa-dri libglu1-mesa freeglut3`
* `libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev`

You MUST have rubygems 0.9.1 or higher installed.  

On Gentoo, Debian and ubuntu, rubygems 0.9.0 will be installed by default
in the packages.  This version of rubygems is INCOMPATIBLE with ruby-opengl.
You'll need to install rubygems from source.

On OS X, you will need to install your own version of Ruby as the
version that ships with OS X has known problems with properly building
ruby-opengl bindings.  You'll also need XCode for gcc and tools.  Macports
or fink should handle this cleanly.

Manual Build instructions
------------------

1. Install rake

   gem install -y rake
2. Install mkrf (Need at least version 0.2.0)
   
   gem install -y mkrf
3. Run 'rake' at the top level of the project
4. Run 'rake test_all' to run unit tests and interactive tests to verify
   it works properly
5. Run 'rake clean' to clean out the project
6. Run 'rake gem' to build a gem
7. Run 'gem install pkg/ruby-opengl-<version>.gem' to install the gem


Installing from rubygems
-------------------

ruby-opengl should also support being installed via gems now.  Just
try 'gem install -y ruby-opengl' and it should pull down the gem
and try to build the bindings for you automatically.

You MUST have rubygems 0.9.1 or higher installed for ruby-opengl
to work properly.  0.8.x and 0.9.0 will not build ruby-opengl
properly.


Testing / Running
-----------------

To run unit tests:

   $ rake test

To run the interactive tests:

   $ rake test_interactive

To run all the tests:

   $ rake test_all

To run a sample file, make sure the ruby-opengl gem is installed then:

    $ cd examples
    $ ruby -rubygems plane.rb

Hit ESC to exit.
